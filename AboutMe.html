							<h1>About me</h1>
							
							<p> <font face = "Brush Script MT" size =" 9">Hi! I am Zoi,</font> a passionate data professional on an unwavering mission to transform lives and empower 
								policymakers with data-driven insights. Through the power of data, I amplify voices, drive change, 
								and unleash the potential of every story. With expertise in survey design, data analysis, visualization, 
								reporting, monitoring and evaluation, and project management, I extract actionable insights from complex datasets, 
								guiding informed decision-making. Together, let's make a lasting impact.<br/>
								<br/>
								Here are some highlights of my career path:</p>
								
								<section>
								<div class="row">
									<ul>
										<li>In 2015, I joined a small local NGO in Athens and embarked on a journey across Greece to collect data and measure the <b>social impact</b> of programs 
											implemented by 9 NGOs in 4 cities. Alongside my colleague, we conducted interviews with 46 NGO stakeholders and surveyed 300 beneficiaries, capturing their stories. 
											Our collaborative efforts resulted in 9 insightful reports that unveiled the transformative power of these initiatives. </li>
										<li>As the Refugee Crisis significantly impacted Greece, I found myself at the heart of change from 2016 to 2018. Guiding the 
											ECHO Emergency support project for 24 intense months, I established the groundwork for a robust <b>M&E (monitoring and evaluation) system</b>, 
											empowering program teams and leading them towards impactful transformations. 
											By setting indicators and developing log frames, I paved the way for transparent tracking and assessment of program progress and impact. </li>
										<li>In 2018, my passion for data-driven decision-making led me to join a consultancy firm specializing in <b>official statistics</b>. 
											With a strong aspiration to work with data that policymakers relied on to shape effective interventions, I engaged in numerous <b>data consultancy projects</b>. 
											The highlight of my journey was my role as a data journalist for Eurostat, where I led a small team and authored over 100 engaging data articles. 
											By transforming raw insights into compelling narratives, my aim was to empower policymakers and foster informed decision-making. </li>
										<li>Motivated by a strong desire to create real impact, in 2022 I embarked on a new adventure and moved to Jordan to 
											work with UNHCR. Overseeing <b>surveys and data research projects</b>, I leveraged my expertise in strategic planning, 
											data analysis, reporting, and stakeholder engagement. Utilizing data analytics and visualization tools, 
											I extracted and manipulated information to provide comprehensive insights that drove informed decision-making and had a positive impact on lives. </li>
									  </ul>
									  <p>Throughout each stage of my career, I have been driven by a thirst for knowledge, 
										  the power of data, and a firm belief in the potential of every individual's story to drive change. </p>

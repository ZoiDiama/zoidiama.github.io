							<h1>HR analytics with Power BI</h1>
							<p> The Power BI dashboard presents insights gathered from the HR Analytics case study from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-hr-analytics-in-power-bi">Datacamp</a>,
								 providing a comprehensive view of key HR metrics and factors affecting attrition within the fictitious organization, 
								 Atlas Labs.</p>
                                 <h3>Report development</h3>
<p>To develop the report, the following steps were followed:</p>
<h4>1.Building the Model and Analyzing the Data </h4>
<p>The primary objective of the report is to monitor key HR metrics concerning employees, while the secondary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence attrition within the organization.</p>
<p>Before diving into the analysis, the datasets were uploaded into Power BI, and a model was created. 
The model consists of five dimension tables (Employee, Educational Level, Rating Level, Satisfaction Level, and Date) 
and one fact table (Performance Rating) that contains information about employees' yearly reviews. Our model adheres to the snowflake schema structure.</p>

</div>

<p>With the data model in place, a thorough exploratory analysis was conducted to unveil insights into various aspects of HR management. 
	The analysis encompassed the examination of general HR trends, including workforce composition and distribution across departments and positions, 
	demographic characteristics of employees, performance ratings, and the identification of key factors that impact attrition within the organization.</p>
<h4>2.	Report Design</h4>
<p>After gaining valuable insights from the exploratory analysis, the next phase involved designing an intuitive and 
	visually appealing report. The report aimed to present the key findings in a clear and concise manner, enabling stakeholders to 
	grasp the essential HR analytics.</p>

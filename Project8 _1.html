							<h1>HR analytics with Power BI</h1>
							<p> This Power BI dashboard presents insights gathered from the HR Analytics case study from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-hr-analytics-in-power-bi">Datacamp</a>,
								 providing a comprehensive view of key HR metrics and factors affecting attrition within the fictitious organization, 
								 Atlas Labs.</p>
                                 
								 <h5>Objective</h5>
								 <p>The primary objective of the report is to monitor key HR metrics concerning employees, while the secondary goal is to gain a deeper 
									understanding of the factors that influence attrition within the organization.</p>

<h5>Building the Model and Analyzing the Data </h5>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Project8_1_Model.png" alt="" /></span>
	Before diving into the analysis, the datasets were uploaded into Power BI, and a model was created.
The model consists of five dimension tables (Employee, Educational Level, Rating Level, Satisfaction Level, and Date) 
and one fact table (Performance Rating) that contains information about employees' yearly reviews. Our model adheres to the snowflake schema structure.</br>
</br>
With the data model in place, a thorough exploratory analysis was conducted to unveil insights into various aspects of HR management. 
The analysis encompassed the examination of general HR trends, including workforce composition and distribution across departments and positions, 
demographic characteristics of employees, performance ratings, and the identification of key factors that impact attrition within the organization.
</p>

<h5>Report Design</h5>
<p>After gaining valuable insights from the exploratory analysis, the next phase involved designing an intuitive and 
	visually appealing report. The report aimed to present the key findings in a clear and concise manner, enabling stakeholders to 
	grasp the essential HR analytics.The report is organized into four sections: an overview, demographics, performance tracker, and attrition.Specifically:
	<ul>
		<li>Overview: The first page serves as an introduction and provides a high-level overview of the HR metrics and attrition analysis. 
			It sets the context for the report and highlights the importance of understanding attrition within the organization.</li>
		<li>Demographics: The second page focuses on analyzing key demographic factors within the organization. By examining variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, and marital status,
			we can gain insights into how different segments of the workforce may be more prone to attrition. 
			Understanding the demographic composition of employees who leave the organization helps identify patterns and potential reasons behind their decision to leave.</li>
		<li>Performance Tracker: The third page is dedicated to tracking and analyzing employee performance metrics. This includes variables such as performance ratings and 
			satisfaction level. This analysis 
			helps in understanding if there are any performance-related factors that contribute to attrition 
			and can guide strategies to improve employee engagement and retention.</li>
		<li>Attrition: The fourth page delves specifically into analyzing attrition within Atlas Labs. It focuses on factors such as travel frequency,overtime, 
			departmental distribution of attrition, and trends over time. This analysis helps in formulating targeted retention strategies and addressing any systemic issues or areas for improvement.</li>

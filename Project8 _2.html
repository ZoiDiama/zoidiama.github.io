							<h1>Solivng Customer Churn</h1>
							<p> The Power BI dashboard showcases the findings extracted from the
								 <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-power-bi">Churn Analytics case study </a>,
								 conducted on a dataset provided by Datacamp. The dataset revolves around a fictional telecom company named Databel, 
								 and my analysis aimed to understand the reasons behind customer churn and explore strategies to minimize it. </p>
                                 <h5>Objective</h5>
								 <p>Investigate the factors contributing to customer churn.The churn rate was calculated using the formula: Churn rate = Number of customers lost / Total number of customers.</p>

								 <h5>Dataset</h5>
								 <p>The dataset utilized for this analysis is a fictional churn dataset obtained from a 
									telecom service provider. It comprises various dimensions, including:</p>

<p>1. Customer ID: Unique identifiers for each customer.</br>
	2. Churn label: A field indicating whether a customer has churned or not.</br>
	3. Demographic fields: Information related to customer demographics.</br>
	4. Premium plans: Details about the premium plans customers may have subscribed to.
</p> 
<h5>Report Design</h5>
<p>The report comprises three pages, focusing on key indicators for demographics, contract type, and charges. Specifically:</br>	
	<ul>
		<li>Demographics: This page is dedicated to examining key indicators related to customer demographics. By analyzing demographic factors such as age, gender, and 
			location, we can gain insights into how different customer segments may be more prone to churn. 
			Understanding the demographic composition of churned customers can help identify patterns and potential reasons behind their decision to leave the company.</li>
		<li>Contract Type: The second page focuses on exploring the impact of different contract types on customer churn. By examining factors such as contract length and 
			type (e.g., one-year, two-year), and payment methods, we can identify whether certain contract types are associated with higher churn rates. 
			This analysis helps in understanding the relationship between contract characteristics and customer retention, which can inform strategies to improve customer loyalty.</li>
		<li>Charges: The third page delves into the examination of charges incurred by customers. This includes analyzing various aspects, 
			such as monthly charges and type of plans. By evaluating the relationship between charges and churn, we can identify whether billing-related issues, 
			unexpected costs, or other financial factors play a significant role in customer attrition. 
			This analysis provides insights into potential areas for improvement in pricing strategies, billing transparency, and customer satisfaction.</li>

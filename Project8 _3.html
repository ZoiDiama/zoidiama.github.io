							<h1>Analyzing Job Market Data</h1>
							<p> TThe Power BI dashboard presents information extracted from a study called
								 <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-job-market-data-in-power-bi">Analyzing Job Market Data in Power BI </a>,
								 which analyzed a dataset provided by Datacamp. In this case study, I worked for a recruitment firm called DataSearch, 
								 aiming to gain insights into job market trends in the field of data science. Recruiters, also known as headhunters, 
								 assist both companies and job seekers in the employment recruitment process. </p>
                                 <h5>Objective</h5>
								 <p>The objective of this study is to investigate the following questions:</br>
									1. What are the most popular jobs in data science?</br>

2. Which data analytical skills are in high demand based on job postings?</br>
3. How frequently are job postings being posted?</br>
4. Are certain companies specifically targeting particular job types, experience levels, or skills?</br>
5. Is there a minimum experience level required for certain roles or skills?</br>


								 .</p>

								 <h5>Dataset</h5>
								 <p>The dataset used in this study consists of job postings from the past 5 years in the data science industry. 
									It includes 19 attributes or columns for each posting, which contain both qualitative and quantitative information. The qualitative columns provide details about the job posting, such as the ID, title, type, level, and required skills. The quantitative columns include information such as posting dates, minimum experience level required in years,
									 minimum and maximum salary offered, and the number of applicants within the first 24 hours.</p>

									 <h5>Data Analysis Focus</h5>
									 <p>The analysis focused on several main job categories within the data science field, including data scientist, 
										data architect, business analyst, data analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer, and data science manager.</p>



<h5>Report Design</h5>
<p>The intended users are the recruiters at DataSearch who will be utilizing this dashboard. 
	As they are familiar with the field, we can assume they will understand the metrics and insights presented. 
	The purpose of the dashboard is to help the recruiters connect job seekers with suitable employers. By identifying potential 
	opportunities for qualified candidates, recruiters can enhance their effectiveness. The focus is on transforming the data insights into a user-friendly format 
	that recruiters can easily utilize. Developing an accessible dashboard is our main priority.</p>
